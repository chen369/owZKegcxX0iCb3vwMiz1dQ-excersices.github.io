# Real Time Bus Tracker

Im Adding animation to maps `mapbox` is an open-source platform that allows you to create and display maps on a web page. The mapboxgl JavaScript library is part of the Mapbox ecosystem. It allows you to add all sorts of customizations to the map. For example, you can add a marker at a specific location on the map.

In this activity, I will be using the MBTA bus data to determine stops between Harvard and MIT. Then, you need to and add an animated marker on the map to highlight the bus routes.
